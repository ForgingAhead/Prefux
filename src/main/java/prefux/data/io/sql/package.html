<p>Input libraries for loading data from SQL databases. One can use the
{@link prefux.data.io.sql.ConnectionFactory} class to obtain an active
{@link prefux.data.io.sql.DatabaseDataSource} that can issue and process
database queries both synchronously and asynchronously.
Translation of database types into
Java data types within prefux data tables is handled by implementations
of the {@link prefux.data.io.sql.SQLDataHandler} interface.</p>
