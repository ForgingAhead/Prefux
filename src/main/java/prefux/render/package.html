<p>Interfaces and modules for rendering VisualItems into a graphics context.
{@link prefux.render.Renderer} instances are responsible for drawing
items, computing item bounds, and determining if a point lies within or 
without an item.
{@link prefux.render.RendererFactory} instances, on the other hand, are
used to determine which Renderer should be used for a given VisualItem.</p>
