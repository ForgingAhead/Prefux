<p>Classes for representing and storing VisualItems. In addition to the top
level {@link prefux.visual.VisualItem} interface, 
{@link prefux.visual.NodeItem} and {@link prefux.visual.EdgeItem} provide
access to an underlying graph structure, {@link prefux.visual.DecoratorItem}
represents a VisualItem "attached to" or "decorating" another VisualItem,
and {@link prefux.visual.AggregateItem} represents an aggregated collection
of VisualItems.</p>

<p>VisualItems descend from the {@link prefux.data.Tuple} interface, and
as such are actually object proxies for a row of a data table. This package
includes the corresponding table and graph implementations, which have been tuned
to the needs of the visual abstraction. More implementational machinery for 
these types is in the {@link prefux.visual.tuple} package.</p>
